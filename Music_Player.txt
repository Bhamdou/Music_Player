The code is designed to function as a music player application with a basic graphical user interface (GUI).

This music player supports operations like playing music, pausing and resuming music, stopping music,
and adjusting the volume.

The GUI is created using tkinter, a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Music playback is handled by the pygame library, which has the mixer module for sound processing.

The mutagen library is used to handle metadata of the music files, like artist and album info and song length.

The user interface includes a list box to display the playlist, buttons to control playback and volume,
a progress bar to show the song's progress, and a metadata label to display song details.

You can add songs to the playlist using the "Add Song(s)" button which opens a file dialog to select .mp3 files.

The volume is adjustable with a slider that changes the volume of the pygame mixer.

The progress bar updates every second using the update_progress() function.
It first gets the length of the currently playing song using mutagen, then runs a for loop for that many seconds,
each time updating the progress bar.

The metadata label gets updated every time a new song is played using the update_metadata() function.
It reads the metadata of the currently playing song using mutagen and sets the metadata label to display this info.
